# UX2 Compatible Modules

UX2 is compatibile with a huge number (many hundreds, if not thousands) of ready-made modules â€“ including sensors, inputs/outputs and controllers.

The interface requirements vary depending on the manufacturer; to help you get started we've provided guidance for using modules from some of the larger manufacturers:

* [ControlEverything](./controleverything/README.md)
* [Gravity (DFRobot)](./gravity/README.md)
* [Grove (Seeed Studio)](./grove/README.md)
* [SparkFun](./sparkfun/README.md)

## Pin variant

UX2-GPIO â€“ four GPIO:

## Wiring

There are two types of Gravity connector - analogue (blue) and digital (green), each using a 3 wire connector:

* `Gx` (GPIO) connects to the Gravity outer green or blue wire (Signal)
* `3V3` connects to the Gravity middle red wire (Voltage or Vcc)
* `GND` connects to the Gravity outer black wire (Ground)

## Host Considerations

Gravity hosts use color-coded male header as illustrated below:

As GPIO can be either analog or digital, you can connect up to 4 Gravity modules to a UX2-GPIO.

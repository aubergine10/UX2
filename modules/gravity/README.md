# Gravity Series (DFRobot)

> Gravity is an open source, plug and play toolkit with over 60 compatible modules which include sensors, motor controllers and human computer interaction devices.

## Pin variant

UX2-GPIO â€“ 4 x GPIO:

## Wiring

There are two types of Gravity connector - analogue (blue) and digital (green), each using a 3 wire connector:

* `Gx` (GPIO) connects to the Gravity outer green or blue wire (Signal)
* `3V3` connects to the Gravity middle red wire (Voltage or Vcc)
* `GND` connects to the Gravity outer black wire (Ground)

As GPIO can be either analog or digital, you can connect up to 4 Gravity modules to a UX2-GPIO.

## Host Considerations

Gravity hosts use color-coded male header. The illustration below shows 2 x Digital and 2 x Analog:

If you provide color-coded header, ensure that analog pins have ADC/DAC capability, and ensure that digital pins have PWM capability.

# I2C Protocol

## IMPORTANT

The I2C standard is based on 5V, but most devices these days are designed to work between 3.3V and 5V due to the growing trend towards lower power devices.

The UX2 Bus is based on an operating voltage of 3.3V and would likely be damaged by higher voltages.

If you encounter an I2C device that requires 5V, you can use a [Level Shifter](https://shop.controleverything.com/collections/bus-handlers/products/i2c-data-and-power-level-shifter-3vdc-to-5vdc-bus-handler) to safely interface to it.

If there is a risk of voltage spikes, you can use a [Power Isolator](https://shop.controleverything.com/collections/bus-handlers/products/iso1541-i2c-data-and-1kv-power-isolator-bus-handler-i2c-mini-module) which can protect against voltages up to 1KV.

## Pin Variants

UX2-GPIO – **1 x I2C**, 4 x GPIO, 1 x UART, 1 x SPI:

UX2-1IS – **1 x I2C**, 1 x 1-WIRE, 1 x INTERRUPT, 1 x UART, 1 x SPI, 1 x SOUND-WIRE:

UX2-ALT – **2 x I2C**, 2 x GPIO, 1 x UART, 1 x SPI:

UX2-I2C – **3 x I2C**, 1 x UART, 1 x SPI:

## Wiring

The I2C standard uses 4 wires; `SDA` (data), `SCL` (clock), `3V3` and `GND`:

| UX2                        | I2C           |
| -------------------------- | ------------- |
| ![SDAx](../../pin/sda.png) | `SDA` (data)  |
| ![SCLx](../../pin/scl.png) | `SCL` (clock) |
| ![3V3](../../pin/3v3.png)  | `VCC`         |
| ![GND](../../pin/gnd.png)  | `GND`         |

It's important to use the same interface pair for each I2C bus. For example, if you're using the UX2-I2C pin variant which provides 3 x I2C interfaces, you have to use `SDA1` and `SCL1` together as a pair, you can't use `SDA1` and `SCL2` as `SCL2` has to be paired with `SDA1`.

You can extend the range of an I2C network using an [Extender Module](https://shop.controleverything.com/collections/bus-handlers/products/long-distance-i2c-bus-extender) (essentially a repeater node) or even with some [clever](http://hackaday.com/2017/02/08/taking-the-leap-off-board-an-introduction-to-i2c-over-long-wires/), [wiring](https://hackaday.com/2017/03/31/an-introduction-to-differential-i%C2%B2c/).
